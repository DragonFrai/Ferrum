# Introduction

**Ferrum** is a .NET (F# + C#) library for working with the dynamic error interface `Ferrum.IError`.
Unlike exceptions, errors are value-orientated and designed to be stored and passed multiple times.

The first library goal is to provide basic error value interfaces that can be used as a common
dynamic interface for error implementation types in the ".NET" ecosystem.

The second library goal is to provide basic ways to create and compose types that implement 
the common error interface.
